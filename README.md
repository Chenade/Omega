>We design a web-based game employing WebGL to engage the players in adventures of space travel while learning knowledge and tackling issues about modern spacecraft propulsion. This game comes with several threads through which to explore the cosmos and challenge problems in cosmic travel. The current setup involves 6 brilliant propulsion engines and 6 magnificent moons, planets or stars in 17 scenarios for the player to complete a cosmic journey of his choice. In summary, this game helps encourage the public, especially the kids, to mobilize their imagination and curiosity based on modern knowledge, and learn to dream big and dare to fail as the universe is full of opportunities.
